# Binary Search

![](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/binary-search.jpg)

## Binary Search Loop

```python
def search(nums, target):
        low, high = 0, len(nums)-1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low+high) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                high = mid -1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return -1

print(search([1,2,3,4,5,6], 4))
```

## Binary Search Recursion

- Note that although the concept is fairly simple, getting all the details right is far more difficult than you might think. Pay attention to the plus ones and minus ones.

```python
def search(nums, target, low, high):
	if low > high:
		return -1
	mid = (low + high) // 2
	if nums[mid] == target:
		return mid
	elif nums[mid] > target:
		return search(nums, target, low, mid-1)
	else:
		return search(nums, target, mid+1, high)

print(search([1,2,3,4,5,6], 4, 0, 6))
```  

## Bug with Binary Search and Merge Sort

- where is the bug/problem
	- `mid = (low + high) // 2`
- how is the bug happening
	- if the sum of low and high is greater than the maximum positive int value (2^31 - 1). The sum overflows to a negative value, and the value stays negative when divided by two
	- This can cause
		- Index out of bound exception, in Java
		- in python this can cause, unexpected result
- what inputs can cause the bug?
	- this bug can manifest itself for arrays whose length (in elements) is 2^30 or greater (roughly a billion elements).
- What is the best way to calculate mid then?

```python
int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);

int mid = (low + high) >>> 1;  #faster and clean [recommended]

int mid = (low + high) >> 1;  #for python

mid = ((unsigned int)low + (unsigned int)high)) >> 1; #for c and c+=
```
