title: Parts of Dockerfile
---

# Parts of Dockerfile

```bash
# Create image based on the official Node image from dockerhub

FROM node:lts-buster

# Create app directory

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy dependency definitions

COPY package.json /usr/src/app

COPY package-lock.json /usr/src/app

# Install dependecies same as npm install
RUN npm ci

# Get all the code needed to run the app
COPY . /usr/src/app

# Expose the port the app runs in

EXPOSE 3000

# Serve the app

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## From

- The OS/framework used. Common is alpine, debian, ubuntu

```bash 
FROM UBUNTU:18:04
FROM node:latest
FROM node:14
```

## WORKDIR

- Sets working directory (also could use 'RUN cd /some/path')

```bash
WORKDIR /app
```

```bash
FROM nginx:latest # Extends nginx so everything included in that image is included here

WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

COPY index.html index.html
```

## ENV

- Environment variables

```bash
ENV NODE_ENV = production
```

## RUN

- Run commands/shell scripts inside the container, etc
- To run commands inside the containers, such as to install dependencies and updates

```bash
RUN npm install
RUN apt-get install -y node
```

## EXPOSE

- Ports to expose
- The `EXPOSE` instruction does not actually publish the port. It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container, about which ports are intended to be published.
	-  It simply is a message for the developer on which port to use, but also the developer can use whichever port it want at runtime.

```bash
EXPOSE 8080
```

### Expose Multiple Port

```bash
EXPOSE 8080 5055 5005
```

## CMD

- The Command that runs when you 'docker run' a new image

```bash
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

### Multiple CMD Can Be Used

```bash
CMD service sshd start && /opt/mq/sbin/rabbitmq-server start
```

## COPY

- Copies files from host to container

```bash
COPY package*.json . #copy package to container
COPY . . #copy everything to container
```

## Build the Docker into Image

- [3. images](Containerization/Docker/3.%20images.md)

## Examples

[More examples here](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose)

### Nodejs Dockerfile

```bash
FROM node:12.18.1

ENV NODE_ENV=production

WORKDIR /app

COPY ["package.json", "package-lock.json*", "./"]

RUN npm install --production

COPY . .

CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
```

> it is a best practice to define a .dockerignore file for your images

```bash
#.dockerignore
node_modules
```

### Spring Boot Dockerfile

```bash
FROM openjdk:16-alpine3.13

WORKDIR /app

COPY .mvn/ .mvn
COPY mvnw pom.xml ./
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline

COPY src ./src

CMD ["./mvnw", "spring-boot:run"]
```
